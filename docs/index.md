Introducing `pyHaiCS`, a Python library for **Hamiltonian-based Monte-Carlo** methods tailored towards practical applications in *computational statistics*. From sampling complex probability distributions, to approximating complex integrals — such as in the context of Bayesian inference — `pyHaiCS` is designed to be fast, flexible, and easy to use, with a focus on providing a user-friendly interface for researchers and practitioners while also offering users a variety of *advanced features*. 

Although currently in development, our library implements a wide range of **sampling algorithms** — including single-chain and multi-chain Hamiltoninan Monte-Carlo (HMC) and Generalized HMC (GHMC); a variety of numerical schemes for the *integration* of the simulated Hamiltonian dynamics (including a generalized version of Multi-Stage Splitting integrators), or a novel *adaptive* algorithm — Adaptive Integration Approach in Computational Statistics (s-AIA) — for the automatic tuning of the parameters of both the numerical integrator and the sampler. 

Likewise, several utilities for *diagnosing* the convergence and efficiency of the sampling process, as well as *multidisciplinary* benchmarks — ranging from simple toy problems such as sampling from specific distributions, to more complex real-world applications in the fields of computational biology, Bayesian modeling, or physics — are provided.
